# Decision Tree Classifier

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python. The Jupyter Notebook (`Decision_tree.ipynb`) includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.

## Features

- Load and preprocess dataset
- Train a Decision Tree classifier
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize the decision tree

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Decision_tree.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

The notebook uses a dataset (either provided in the script or needs to be uploaded manually). Ensure the dataset is in the correct format before executing the notebook.

## Model Evaluation

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Visualization

The decision tree structure is visualized using `graphviz` and `matplotlib`. Ensure Graphviz is installed:

```bash
pip install graphviz
```

For system-level installation (if needed):

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz   # Ubuntu
brew install graphviz       # macOS
```

## Contributions

Feel free to fork the repository and contribute by improving the model or adding new features.
